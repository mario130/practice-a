# Tween 11
A website i coded with the purpose of honing my skills in using css without external libraries like bootstrap, only Media Query from scratch to make it fully responsive. It was much easier to get the specific design I wanted. See the [live version](https://mario130.github.io/practice-a/dist/homepage.html).

### Technologies used
- Pug (HTML)
- Sass (CSS)
- Javascript & jQuery

### Project duration
> It took me 20 hours over 5 days to finish the website but I still update it occasionally.

### Lessons learned
Building websites from scratch is fun although it's time consuming, but the final result can be very rewarding

### Next steps
- [x] Include favicon
- [ ] Add loading screen
- [ ] Add more animations
- [ ] Add one more page
